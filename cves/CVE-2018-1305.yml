description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Security constraints were only applied once a Servelet was loaded. That means 
  they were applied only to the URL pattern. So depending on the order the Servlets
  were loaded you could cause some constraints to not be applied. This then leaves 
  open holes for exploits such as elevated privilege. You instead need the Servlets
  to all load first so all the security constraints are taken care of. 

bounty_instructions: |
  If you came across any indications that a bounty was paid out for this
  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here

  Students: when initially writing this, ignore this upvotes number.
  Once this work is being reviewed, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    The code is automatically unit tested before being deployed. This
    vulnerability was not tested though. They did not change their unit tests during
    or after the fix. This is probably because they just replaced how they were
    loading the security constraints and so it didn't need testing as it couldn't
    work the way it did before.
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    I couldn't seem to find the actual bug report on their bug site bugzilla.
    I was able to find their announcement of the vulnerablilty in their patch notes.
    These say that the bug was discovered by the apache team. This is the only real 
    explanation given but it seems it was discovered by devs and not outsiders.
  date: 2018-02-01
  automated: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: It was inside apache's servlet subsystem.
  name: Catalina

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There was actually about 8 years of code between the inital set up of the 
    servlets deploying the way they do and the decision to no longer deploy them this way.
    Due to this there were many interesting commits but actually none of them interfering
    with servlet deploying code except for the VCC and fixes.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      They thought they might need the servlets to load at seperate times 
      than the web app itself. They learned after this error that this wasn't
      actually necessary and were able to replace it.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    It seems their issue was both a design mistake and a bit of an oversight on 
    their part. Initally back in 2010 they believed they wanted to be able to
    deploy servlets at different times. This still is true. But what they didn't
    think was that in the future the servlets would have secuirty constraints placed
    on them and this order would be exploitable. They mitigated this risk by forcing
    the servlets to run their security checks on web application start instead of on
    their own time. This solution seems wise to me. Now the timing doesn't really matter
    because it is all happening before the application launches.
